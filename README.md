# amazon-mysql

This project uses mySQL, mySQL workbench, inquirer, node, and javascript. 
The database contains ten different products with their prices and stock quantity. When the user loads the file, inquirer prompts the user to select the item they would like to buy, and then asks them how much of the product they would like to buy. If there is enough stock to fill the order, they are told the price of their order and the amount of stock is updated in the database. If there is not enough stock, they are told the order can't be filled.
